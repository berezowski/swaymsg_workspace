      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
